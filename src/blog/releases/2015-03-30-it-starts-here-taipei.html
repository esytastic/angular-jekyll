                        <p><strong>Gogoro | MARCH 30, 2015</strong></p>

                        <h2>It Starts Here: Taipei</h2>

                        <p><i>Gogoro® has set its sights high with an ambitious vision for bringing change to the world through transforming how megacities distribute and manage energy.</i></p>

                        <p>We realize one company can’t accomplish this, it takes different communities, organizations and governments working together to drive innovative new thought, business models and inventions but we strongly believe this will bring dramatic social, economic and environmental improvements for generations to come.</p>

                        <p>Our journey has been full of amazing steps, some public and some more internal but today we’re excited to take another big public step in announcing Taipei Taiwan as our first Gogoro pilot market.  Comprised of Taipei City and New Taipei City, Greater Taipei as a pilot market has a strong track record of embracing innovation while also having the world’s highest concentration of two-wheel vehicles—it’s hard to think of a more appealing and exciting place for us to pilot the Smartscooter™ electric vehicle and Gogoro Energy Network.</p>

                        <p>Taipei residents love getting around on two wheels—there is nearly a 1:1 ratio of scooters to people. As part of its partnership with Gogoro and its initiative to help Greater Taipei continue on its path to becoming a smart city, the Taipei City and New Taipei City governments are increasing the financial incentives pool for citizens to retire their gas-powered scooters, through programs like expanded subsidies for electric vehicle purchases.  Both cities are also introducing preferred parking throughout their cities for electric vehicles. </p>

                        <p>We’re kicking off our pilot program with the establishment of the Gogoro Experience Center, our first retail flagship store opening today in Taipei City’s prime Xinyi shopping district. Through a gallery of hands-on and highly interactive experiences, the center offers customers an up-close look at the Smartscooter™ EV’s design and customization, technical innovations and craftsmanship.  Customers can also learn about the Gogoro Energy Network while interacting with the GoStation™, the swappable battery vending machine.</p>

                        <h3>Smartscooter™ EV and Gogoro Energy Network</h3>

                        <p>Gogoro introduced the Gogoro Smartscooter™ EV and Gogoro Energy Network earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show. The Smartscooter™ EV is the world’s first high-performance, smart electric two-wheel vehicle with swappable batteries. The integrated Gogoro Energy Network is an advanced battery-swapping infrastructure for cities.</p>

                        <p>The main feature of the Gogoro Energy Network is the GoStation™. About the size of an ATM, the GoStation™ is where riders swap their used batteries for new ones.  As the filling stations of the future, GoStation™ will crop up in all sorts of places throughout a city—a gas station, in front of a shop, on a street corner, in a parking garage, under an overpass, etc.</p>

                        <p>Population growth requires us to get creative about how we use resources so the places that the Gogoro Energy Network can do the most good are in the world’s megacities, where traffic, pollution and fuel consumption are highly concentrated.</p>

                        <p>This is just the beginning, we’re looking forward to bringing the Gogoro Energy Network to many other cities where escalating population density and eagerness for innovation create the perfect opportunities for Smartscooter™ EVs and smarter infrastructure. </p>

                        <p>The Gogoro Energy Network’s portable power ecosystem will transform the way the world’s most populated megacities distribute and utilize energy. Taipei is step one. We’re looking forward to everywhere else in the world this journey will take us.</p>

                        <p>We want to capture the hearts and minds of a generation who want to be catalysts for more efficient, cleaner, and smarter energy choices without sacrificing performance, style or comfort and we believe the Gogoro Smartscooter™ EV and Gogoro Energy Network will do that. </p>
