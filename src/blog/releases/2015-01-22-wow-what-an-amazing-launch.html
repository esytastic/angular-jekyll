                        <p><strong>Gogoro | JANUARY 22, 2015</strong></p>

                        <h2>WOW, WHAT AN AMAZING LAUNCH!</h2>

                        <p>It has been an incredible start of the year for Gogoro! We were amazed at the level of excitement we received at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, and the continued interest we’re seeing from around the world has been overwhelming.</p>

                        <p>The positive comments and strong first impressions from the world’s most influential media, industry analysts and influencers on the Smartscooter and our vision are clear indications that we are not alone in seeing the need for change in the world’s cities. We fundamentally believe that this moment is bigger than one person or company: it represents a vision of change for all of us, a vision for transforming how our cities will function more efficiently and effectively in the future. </p>

                        <p>As we mentioned in our first <a href="/blog/2015-01-05-ready-set-go">blog post</a> the Gogoro Energy Network was our biggest announcement in many ways. Many journalists who covered it agreed, with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gogoro-the-the-tesla-of-scooters-2015-1" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> declaring, “The real genius of the Gogoro Energy Network is its state-of-the-art battery switching system.” <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/gogoro-battery-swapping/" target="_blank">WIRED</a> praised the battery-swapping system as “so understandable” and “delightfully easy,” concluding, “… as impressive as the scooter is, it’s nothing compared to the innovative system that lets customers swap depleted batteries for fresh ones at ATM-sized stations.” </p>

                        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mashable/statuses/552107234025824256" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.gogoroapp.com/blog/bolg-20150122-001.png" alt="twitter"></a></p><br />

                        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/PopSci/statuses/553647915357732866" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.gogoroapp.com/blog/bolg-20150122-002.png" alt="twitter"></a></p>

                        <p>There was plenty of excitement for the Gogoro Smartscooter itself, though, with mainstream media, tech blogs and green-focused outlets using words like “innovative,” “revolutionary” and “much-awaited”. One story called the technology “cool and intriguing,” praising the slick and beautiful design. Another writer described the scooter as “the most luxurious and tricked out scooter [I’ve] ever seen.” <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jan/08/ces-2015-technology-changes-marketing" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> wrote that with faster electronic scooters such as ours on the market, “mobility is being redefined.” </p>

                        <p>Many journalists pointed out how ambitious our plans are; one said that Gogoro could "hold the potential to wipe out the competition and completely transform urban transportation.” We’ve received positive reactions from broadcast media as well; ABC News hosts T.J. Holmes and Reena Ninan called the Gogoro Smartscooter “the biggest buzz” from CES. Tech authority Walt Mossberg highlighted the hottest gadgets of CES on <a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000344011&play=1" target="_blank">CNBC’s</a> Squawk Valley, praising our “really handsome” Smartscooter while pointing out that “[Gogoro has] got to build a whole infrastructure for these batteries … This is not just another scooter.” VentureBeat news editor Harrison Weber appeared on Fox Business and called out Gogoro’s Smartscooter as one of “the best products” he saw at CES 2015. </p>

                        <p>USA Today’s personal tech columnist Ed Baig paid us a visit at CES, as did producers of CNBC’s Squawk Valley and other technology media from various broadcasts, publications and blogs. We especially enjoyed talking with Walt Mossberg, who—as you can see in the tweet below —tried out many of the Smartscooter’s features, particularly the horn. We also got online shout outs from many tech observers and industry figures who weren’t at CES, including T-Mobile CEO John Legere, Nest CEO Tony Fadell, <a href="https://twitter.com/sasakitoshinao/statuses/552604021815799808" target="_blank">@sasakitoshinao</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ivivekkm/statuses/552308048212291585" target="_blank">@VivekoMON</a> and more.</p>

                        <p>We were deeply honored to receive accolades at the show from Engadget, Geek Beat, <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/01/06/best-of-ces-2015/" target="_blank">Mashable</a> <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/news/ces-2015-popular-mechanics-awards-13#slide-13" target="_blank">Popular Mechanics</a> Popular Science, SlashGear, T3, Trusted Reviews, The Verge and more. Spotlighting Gogoro for its “Best in Show” honor, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7509787/verge-awards-best-of-ces-2015" target="_blank">The Verge</a> said Gogoro “might soon be about much more than scooters…but the scooter’s plenty awesome all on its own.” <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/slashgears-best-of-ces-2015-09363540/" target="_blank">SlashGear</a> applauded the “smart[ness]” of the battery-swapping system, adding that Gogoro is “at the heart of a power-swapping ecosystem that could one day power city cars and more, an ambitious play to shake up not only traditional gasoline vehicles but even more recent electric cars and plug-in hybrids.” </p>

                        <p>We hit the ground fast at CES, and we have no intention of slowing down, the introduction of the Smartscooter and Gogoro Energy Network are just the beginning. </p>
