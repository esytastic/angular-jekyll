                        <p><strong>LAS VEGAS | JANUARY 5, 2015</strong></p>

                        <h2>Gogoro® Ignites Smart City Transformation with Launch of World’s First Smartscooter™ and Battery Swapping Infrastructure</h2>

                        <p><i>Gogoro Energy Network enables advanced six second battery swapping; Propels megacity transition toward a more efficient, cleaner and flexible energy future</i></p>

                        <p><strong>LAS VEGAS – JANUARY 5, 2015 (CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW) –</strong> Gogoro, a company transforming how energy is distributed and managed in megacities, today unveiled the world’s first high-performance, zero emissions, two-wheeled electric vehicle, the Gogoro Smartscooter™. The company also announced the Gogoro Energy Network, a battery swapping infrastructure that will enable a more efficient, cleaner and flexible energy future.</p>

                        <p>“With the world’s megacities at a tipping point in population density, pollution fallout and rapid expansion, it is essential that we reimagine the energy infrastructure and create a renewed mindset for change in tomorrow’s urban generation,” said Horace Luke, co-founder and CEO, Gogoro. “The Smartscooter and Gogoro Energy Network will capture the hearts of the next generation and become a catalyst for more efficient, cleaner, and smarter energy choices in our cities.”</p>

                        <p>The Gogoro Energy Network is a modular battery-swapping infrastructure that can be deployed across a city to provide broad consumer access to portable power through battery vending machines called GoStations. The Gogoro Battery is an engineering breakthrough with a variety of technologies including 25 sensors, near field communication (NFC) connectivity and 256-bit security encryption. It utilizes Panasonic’s industry-leading cylindrical 18650-size automotive-grade lithium-ion energy cells to deliver the ultimate in safety, performance, efficiency and portability. The Smartscooter is the first vehicle to be integrated into the Gogoro Energy Network, and both will begin initial rollout in 2015.  ”Gogoro is more than a startup. This is the start of an industry,” said Luke. “Our products and business model will impact a variety of consumer areas to create a metropolitan ecosystem with better connectivity, easier access to energy, and a more enjoyable urban living experience.” </p>

                        <h3>About the Gogoro Smartscooter™</h3>

                        <p>From the drivetrain to the dashboard, the Smartscooter utilizes the precision, processes and materials used for supercars to offer top-level performance that is both user-friendly and accessible to the mass market. In order to deliver unprecedented power, agility, acceleration and handling, Gogoro reimagined the entire ride experience and then created a unique powertrain, chassis, suspension and electronics to deliver the best efficiency, handling, acceleration and riding range possible.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Gogoro G1 Motor –</strong> Power-packed and ultra-compact, the G1 Motor redefines what’s possible in electric motor design. Every component is precision-engineered to ensure the entire system works smarter, stays cooler and goes further in the most efficient way possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aeroframe™ –</strong> Ultra lightweight and incredibly strong, Gogoro’s Aeroframe monocoque chassis is stamped out of racing grade aluminum that makes it stiffer, stronger, lighter and more responsive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Race Suspension –</strong> The Smartscooter delivers an amazingly smooth and responsive ride even in dynamic conditions at speed. This performance stability comes from Gogoro’s high-performance suspension that is inspired by jet-fighter landing gear in the front and multi-link suspension in the back.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance and Agility –</strong> Designed with the rider in mind, the Smartscooter reaches perfect 50/50 balance when the rider sits and becomes an integrated extension of the Smartscooter. This amazing balance and agility enable greater stability, a tight 48.5° lean angle and ultimately a more enjoyable riding experience.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Smartscooter is Smarter</h3>

                        <p>The Smartscooter harnesses the power of 30 onboard sensors, cloud connectivity, and an integrated Gogoro mobile application that enables the scooter to get smarter and more efficient with every ride. The Gogoro iQ System™ puts the power of a personal computer in the Smartscooter, synchronizing wirelessly across the Smartscooter, Gogoro app, Gogoro Battery, GoStation™ and Gogoro Energy Network. The app utilizes the Gogoro iQ System to find the closest GoStation, deliver detailed scooter diagnostics, adaptive throttle control, customized regenerative braking, and the ability to track ride details like the top speed and range so the rider can analyze riding patterns to optimize power and energy consumption.</p>

                        <h3>Smartscooter is Easier</h3>

                        <p>Riders don’t need to wait to refuel or recharge the Smartscooter. When a depleted battery needs to be swapped with a charged one, riders can make a six-second swap at any GoStation. Batteries can be reserved in advance, and a subscription-based payment model offers unlimited access to as many charged batteries as needed. Also, with Smartscooter’s hyper-connectivity, if vehicle servicing is needed, the rider is immediately alerted via the Gogoro mobile app or at the GoStation when swapping batteries.</p>

                        <h3>Smartscooter is Customizable</h3>

                        <p>Designed from the outset to be individualized, Gogoro gives unique control to each rider to select the specific ride feel and throttle acceleration, the dashboard screen color spectrum and the lock-and-unlock audio and lighting themes. There is also a broad variety of practical and designed-oriented accessories to add enhanced functionality or customized body details.</p>

                        <p>Founded by technology veterans Luke and co-founder and CTO Matt Taylor, the Smartscooter and Gogoro Energy Network are Gogoro’s first products. In October 2014, Gogoro announced it had raised $50 million in Series A funding in 2011, and is currently closing its Series B round of $100 million to commercialize and go-to-market in 2015.</p>

                        <p>The Gogoro Smartscooter and GoStation will be on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5-9, 2015, at select locations, including: </p>
