                        <p><strong>PARIS, FRANCE | DECEMBER 3, 2015</strong></p>

                        <h2>Gogoro CEO Horace Luke To Speak At The Sustainable Innovation Forum At COP21 In Paris</h2>

                        <p><i>Gogoro is focused on deploying an energy alternative that is portable, easily accessible and hyper-connected so cities can become smarter, cleaner and more efficient.</i></p>

                        <p><strong>PARIS FRANCE ─ December 3, 2015 (COP21)</strong> ─ Gogoro, a technology company transforming how energy is distributed and managed in megacities, today announced co-founder and CEO Horace Luke would be speaking at the Sustainable Innovation Forum at COP21 in Paris on Tuesday, December 8th. Luke will be highlighting Gogoro’s successful deployment in Greater Taipei this year and how the collaboration between the public and private sector were key in making it a reality. Gogoro will also be exhibiting its battery-swapping stations and the Gogoro Smartscooter at the Sustainable Innovation Forum and Solutions COP21 exhibition.
                        	</p>
                        <p>"One of the greatest challenges of our time is determining how we distribute and experience energy in a smarter way to have the greatest impact on our lives and the lives of future generations,” said Luke. “At Gogoro, we are relentlessly pursuing our vision to transform the world's most populated megacities into smart cities with product and business model innovations that will provide cleaner and smarter energy to as many people as possible.”</p>

                        <h3>The Gogoro Energy Network</h3>
                        <p>The Gogoro Energy Network makes owning electric vehicles in megacities practical by removing the greatest barriers to adoption: the lack of private parking spaces, and the lack of charging stations in the few spaces that are available. The Gogoro Energy Network provides riders with a fast, easy way to swap depleted batteries for charged ones. Similar in size to an ATM machine, the GoStations will be available in places like gas stations, parking lots, malls, convenience stores, and other locations where people already take their vehicles on a regular basis. The GoStations are modular and take roughly 30 minutes to install, which makes it easy to place them where they’re needed most.</p>
                        <p>“With the world’s megacities at a tipping point in population density, pollution fallout and rapid expansion, it is essential that we reimagine the energy infrastructure and create a renewed mindset for change in tomorrow’s urban generation. The Gogoro Smartscooter and Gogoro Energy Network are catalysts for more efficient, cleaner, and smarter energy choices in our cities,” said Luke. </p>

                        <h3>Sustainable Innovation Forum at COP21</h3>
                        <p>The Sustainable Innovation Forum takes place on December 7th and 8th at Stade de France, just outside of Paris. Now in its 6th year and hosted by Climate Action and the UNEP, SIF15 is endorsed by the host country and organizer of COP21, the French Government.  The forum is the largest business focused event taking place during the COP, uniting 750 global delegates from public and private sector organizations to catalyze the partnerships needed to accelerate low carbon development solutions.</p>

                        <h3>Solutions COP21 Exhibition</h3>
                        <p>The Solutions COP21 exhibition welcomes close to 50,000 local visitors to the Grand Palais to experience and discover existing practical solutions to take us forward to the post-carbon era. The agenda led by Comité 21 and Club France Développement Durable will bring together non-State actors to share their climate solutions with a wide audience.  Hundreds of climate solutions to move with the times, presented by up to 200 partners in 35 pavilions and exhibition areas.</p>
