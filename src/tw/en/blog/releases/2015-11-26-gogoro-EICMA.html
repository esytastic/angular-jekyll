                        <h2>Gogoro Announced Amsterdam as First Expansion City</h2>
                        <p>We just returned from an amazing trip to Europe where Gogoro exhibited at EICMA, the international motorcycle and scooter show in Milan Italy.  Our big news was announcing Amsterdam as our first global expansion city in 2016. </p>

                        <h3>Gogoro at EICMA</h3>
                        <p>The response to the Gogoro Smartscooter, Gogoro Energy Network and the Gogoro business model was incredible with many visitors telling us Gogoro was the greatest thing they saw at the show. We also had many of the industry’s most revered designers visit and share their admiration, here are quotes from three of them: </p>
                        <p>“Level of Attention to detail is amazing”</p>
                        <p>“Greatest thing I've seen in ten years” at EICMA”  </p>
                        <p>“I envy your level of design” </p>
                        <p>We had visitors from all over the world asking to partner with us to bring Gogoro to their cities.  </p>
                        <p><strong>Here are some photos from our stand at the show.  </strong></p>

                        <h3>Gogoro In Amsterdam in 2016</h3>
                        <p>As a global leader in urban efficiency and clean energy adoption, Amsterdam has introduced the Amsterdam Smart City (ASC), a unique partnership between companies, governments, knowledge institutions and the people of Amsterdam. It is a frontrunner in the development of Amsterdam as a Smart City. Gogoro will be participating in the Smart City Experience Lab where the Gogoro Smartscooter™ EV, Gogoro Energy Network and GoStation® will be demonstrated. </p>
                        <p>“Amsterdam is widely considered a forward thinking global leader in smart city innovation and we are excited to be welcoming Gogoro to Amsterdam as a participant in Amsterdam’s Smart City Experience Lab and as Gogoro’s first European market,” said Ger Baron, CTO at the City of Amsterdam. "Electric transport is not only the future, but happening right now. The next wave of innovation is the integration of electric vehicles into the energy grid, EV charging and storage will be part of the energy-internet. Gogoro is now bringing scooters to the 21st century and connecting them to the smart energy ecosystem.”</p>
                        <p>Gogoro will be opening a Gogoro Experience Boutique in Amsterdam in the first half of 2016 and additional cities later in 2016. The boutiques will provide hands-on and highly interactive experiences for consumers to learn about the Gogoro Smartscooter™ EV through a curated gallery demonstrating Gogoro’s craftsmanship, technology, style and personalization.</p>
